# About Object-oriented Programming

## Object-oriented Programming

OOP is a way to decompose a problem using the notion of things
(objects) and how the things interact with one another. Object-
oriented design can be thought of as _modeling the world in
state_. State can be imagined as the descriptive properties
of a thing. The state of a dog might be it's weight, color,
and age.

Contrast with functional programming, FP, which uses operations
as the fundamental units of decomposition. It can be thought
of as _modeling the world in transformations_.

There are a few ways that a language might support object
orientation. One is through the notion of object classes.
Another centers on the idea of object prototypes. In any
case, the fundamental unit of an object-oriented language
is an object.

This presentation focuses on class-based OOP but the principles
apply to protypal OOP as well.

- Inheritance and Polymorphism
- Encapsulation an Information Hiding
